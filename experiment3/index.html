				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project generates a procedurally created overworld map using noise-based terrain generation and tile-based rendering. 
					The map includes water, dirt, grass, trees, and a house. Each time the seed is changed, a new world is generated with different 
					terrain layout and tile placement.</p>

				<p>
					The world shows signs of life with animated cloud chunks that drift slowly across the screen over time. 
					Each cloud is made up of multiple tiles to create cohesive cloud clusters. This animation brings visual movement to 
					the overworld and adds depth to the environment.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The grid is displayed as editable ASCII characters. Users can modify the world by changing the character codes in the grid box:
					<ul>
						<li>"W" represents water</li>
						<li>":" represents dirt</li>
						<li>"_" represents grass</li>
						<li>"T" represents trees</li>
						<li>"H" represents a house (only one is placed per map)</li>
					</ul>
					These codes are processed by drawGrid() and matched with specific tile positions from the tileset.?
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was pretty difficult to work on by myself, but I learned a lot—especially with cloud animation and autotiling. I’m still figuring out some parts, but I’m proud of how much I was able to get working. Overall, it was a rewarding experience and helped me grow more confident in my coding skills.</p>
